Theres tapping coming in from the wires. What's it saying nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 21610.
```

Connecting to the server gave me this
```
.--. .. -.-. --- -.-. - ..-. { -- ----- .-. ... ...-- -.-. ----- -.. ...-- .---- ... ..-. ..- -. ...-- ----. ----- ..--- ----- .---- ----. ..... .---- ----. }
```

Anyone who have been in crypto challenges surely encountered this cipher. This is called Morse Code. Anywhere if you see a ciphertext have dots and dashes it will most likely
be a Morse Code
Going to ```https://cryptii.com/``` and decrypting the morse code will give the flag
