Challenge:
```
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/
```
Looking at the website, it is only a static website
<img src="1.PNG" />

So going to robots.txt and see the contents it has
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```
So going to the ```/477ce.html``` gave me the flag
```
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}
```
