Challenge:
```
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/
```

Going to the webpage provided me with a login prompt

<img src="1.PNG" />

After logging in with some random creds gave me this

<img src="2.PNG" />

It took me some time after that i noticed the cookie of the admin is set to ```False```
So just changed the admin cookie to ```True```, after that refresh the page
and this will give the flag
