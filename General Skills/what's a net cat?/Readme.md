Challenge:
```
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 64287 to get the flag?
```

Just netcat to the server. The command will be
```
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 64287
```
And it will give the following output
```
You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
```

flag:```picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}```
