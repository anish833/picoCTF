Challenge
```
We found this file. Recover the flag.
```

They gave us the file called mystery and running file command gave me
```
mystery: data
```
I used strings to get the readable character of the file and got ```IEND``` as the last line so it is probably a png file
So to view the hex dump i used bless it has more features than the hexeditor in linux
