Challenge:
```
There's something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?
```

They gave me a ```png``` image file

<img src="buildings.png" />

So as use ```strings``` and ```exiftool``` but nothing showed up. Then I tried steganography tools on the image I used the tool ```zsteg```
which only supports ```png``` file like ```steghide``` for ```jpg```. I ran zsteg
